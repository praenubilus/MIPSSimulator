Due to the nature of Python, to run the program, compiling is not required. Just make sure both MIPSsim.py and
mips32.py files are in the current folder/path. to run the program you may use the following format:

python3 MIPSsim.py <inputfilename> <outputfilename> <operation> [-Tm:n]

For more information on how to use the arguments of the program, use the following command in the terminal/console:

python3 MIPSsim.py -h
